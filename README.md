This is one of the first HTML website building projects I have made. This is a calculator that can take input given to it through the buttons and performs calculations based on the user specification. The website was built on HTML and was styled using CSS. The actual functionality of the website was made using Java Script.

I believe that building a calculator is one of the best beginner projects as we can learn input, displaying the inputted data, and then showing the outputs made by the program.
